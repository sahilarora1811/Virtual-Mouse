This project helps the users to use a virtual mouse instead of a physical mouse.It can be used in situations where it is not possible to use the physical mouse .The main objective of the proposed system is to perform computer mouse cursor functions and scroll function using a web camera or a built-in camera in the computer instead of using a traditional mouse device. The algorithm used in the system makes use of the machine learning algorithm.
WORKING : In the proposed system, the web camera captures and then processes the frames that have been captured and then recognizes the various hand gestures and hand tip gestures and then performs the particular mouse function. For the purpose of detection of hand gestures and hand tracking, the MediaPipe framework is used, and OpenCV library is used for computer vision. The algorithm makes use of the machine learning concepts to track and recognize the hand gestures and hand tip. The various functions and conditions used in the system are explained in the flowchart of the real-time AI virtual mouse system.

To run the code you need to install Mediapipe, colorama, Pyautogui, OpenCV2 in your application (Pycharm, VScode)
